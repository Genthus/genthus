      <description>It has been around 400 days since I got started on the journey to become jozu, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of Japanese, and also learned a lot about learning to learn Japanese. Stick around and maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll misinterpret my advice and come up with something that&amp;rsquo;s actually useful.
I think the moment I decided to learn Japanese might have been with the release of the Tsukihime remake, I remember telling myself that I could probably learn Japanese earlier than there would be a decent translation of it, and from there I downloaded Duolingo because &amp;ldquo;how else does one start learning a language&amp;rdquo;.</description>
