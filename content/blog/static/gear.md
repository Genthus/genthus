# Drawing

- XP-Pen Artist 24 (2k QHD version)
  > So far this has been a really nice pen display, I think I got it for aroung 600 USD and its been well worth it.
  > If you're thinking of buying a pen display, I really think you should get a 2k QHD one and definitely look out for the color accuracy.
- MidiFighter 3D
  > Got this used from somewhere and its just a MIDI device with a lot of buttons.
  > Instead of buying something expensive like a tourbox or a drawing controller, look out for used MIDI controllers and get something like MidiKey2Key to set up your hotkeys for drawing.
