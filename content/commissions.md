# Process

## 1. Contact

Send your request through this form or by contacting me on social media.

## 2. Drafting

Once Iâ€™ve received your request, I'll work out a very rough draft and contact you for approval so I can start working on the piece. Revisions to this draft can be made but if an excessive amount of revisions are made I will charge for the time spent (Up to 5$ USD).

## 3. Payment

Once the draft has your approval, I will invoice the PayPal you'll be using for payment. Any payment made before this step will be refunded. Once the amount has been paid, I'll start working on the piece.

## 4. During the process

While working on the piece I will provide occasional updates. Small adjustments can be requested, however I will decide whether to accept them or not. Major changes will not be tolerated. I may contact you for clarification on your character if you requested an OC.

## 5. Delivery

Once the piece is finished, I will deliver the finished image. Color-correction and basic editing of the image can be requested. No refunds will be made after the piece has been finished and delivered.

If what you want to request isn't contemplated in this page or you have any questions, feel free to DM me on social media or send an email to commissions@genthus.art
