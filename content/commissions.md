# Process

### 1. Contact

>Send your request through this form or by contacting me on social media.

### 2. Drafting

>Once Iâ€™ve received your request, I'll work out a very rough draft and contact you for approval so I can start working on the piece. Revisions to this draft can be made but if an excessive amount of revisions are made I will charge for the time spent (Up to 5$ USD).

### 3. Payment

>Once the draft has your approval, I will invoice the PayPal you'll be using for payment. Any payment made before this step will be refunded. Once the amount has been paid, I'll start working on the piece.

### 4. Drawing

>While working on the piece I will provide occasional updates. Small adjustments can be requested, however I will decide whether to accept them or not. Major changes will not be tolerated. I may contact you for clarification on your character if you requested an OC.

### 5. Delivery

>Once the piece is finished, I will deliver the finished image. Color-correction and basic editing of the image can be requested. No refunds will be made after the piece has been finished and delivered.
